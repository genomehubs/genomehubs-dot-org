Draft documentation for our [dockerised setup](https://easy-import.readme.io/v1.0/docs/dockerised-setup) is available alongside the original [EasyImport documentation](https://easy-import.readme.io/).

We'll be updating this soon to reflect all the recent changes we've made in moving our setup into containers.
